## Getting involved in ACCESS-AM3

There are several ways we welcome feedback and contributions on ACCESS-AM3 development. **Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged.** Development is led by ACCESS-NRI, the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Weather in the 21st Century (W21C). We follow a collaborative development workflow, building on the work of international modelling groups.

### Interact with developers in person

If you would like to interact in person with the development team, there are regular Land Working Group meetings on the first and third Wednesday of every month (see [this thread](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/land-working-group-announce/355) on the ACCESS-Hive Forum) and Atmosphere Working Group meetings are organised on an ad-hoc basis (see [this thread](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/announce-atmosphere-working-group/568) on the ACCESS-Hive Forum). Everyone is welcome to suggest agenda items and participate (see the threads for the respective agendas). If you'd like to come, get in touch on ACCESS-Hive Forum under the [ACCESS-AM3](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/atmosphere/am3/243) category.

We also manage most of our development on GitHub. We track ACCESS-AM3 work on a [GitHub project board here](https://github.com/orgs/ACCESS-NRI/projects/35). If you'd like to have your issue considered for ACCESS-AM3 development, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs/issues/new) on the ACCESS-AM3 configurations repository.

!!! warning
    This model uses components and science configurations from the UK Met Office (UKMO), and as such are license restricted. This means the associated repositories are required to be private. If you would like to be granted access to these repositories, please get in touch by replying to [this ACCESS-Hive Forum topic](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/request-access-to-am3-configurations-draft/5580).

### Help us evaluate and improve applications of AM

We hope to make the evaluation of ACCESS-AM3 a community effort. There is a [community evaluation](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-am3-paper-1) repository which will be used as a central location for storing scripts and programs used to evaluate the scientific performance of the model. We host coupled model evaluation meetings which anyone is welcome to join- see the **CM3 Dev-Eval Meeting** announcements on the [ACCESS-Hive Forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/esm-working-group-announce/567/68).

### Report a bug or make a suggestion

Technical issues related to ACCESS-AM3 are best posted to [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs/issues](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs/issues/new). If you would like to discuss the issue first, feel free to post it on the [ACCESS-HIVE forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/atmosphere/am3/243).

## ACCESS-AM3-configs-doc documentation contributions welcome 🙏 { #contribute-to-docs }

This documentation is a work in progress, and we welcome any contributions, including corrections and suggestions.

All contributions are welcome but we would particularly appreciate text suggestions (below). Contributions can be made in a few ways:

### Quick contributions 
!!! tip
    This method has the advantage that it's *very quick* (<1 minute!). The caveat is that, unless you have write access to the `access-am3-configs-doc` repository, you will not be able to preview the changes rendered into a website or create whole new pages. <br>

The simplest and fastest way to make a change to an _existing_ page is to click the edit "pencil" on the top-right corner. This will go to the relevant GitHub markdown file and clicking the top-right pencil again on GitHub will allow you to edit the file. Once complete, click `Commit changes...`. There are then _two_ possibilities, depending on whether you have  write access to [`access-am3-configs-doc`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc): 

1.  **No write access**: this will prompt you to make a fork and then a pull request (less than 1 minute!). 
1.  **You have write access**: please commit changes on a new branch and then use a pull request (this relates to the next option). 

### Larger contributions (online PR-previews)
!!! tip
    This method allows you create whole new pages, and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It does not require you to install any software, but is **only available for people with write access to [`access-am3-configs-doc`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc)**.<br>

Create a new branch, e.g. `jblogs/doc-update`, make doc changes (the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation)), then open a related PR and a GitHub preview will be made automatically. 

### Larger contributions (`mkdocs` offline)
!!! tip
    This method allows you create whole new pages and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It works whether or not you have write access to [`access-am3-configs-doc`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc), but requires you to install `mkdocs` and takes the longest to set up.<br>

Following [these instructions](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/#lets-get-started) but noting the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation). You'll need to [fork](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/#clone-the-forked-access-hive-docs-github-repository-locally) and clone [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc) if you want to write your own content (`mkdocs serve` should be invoked from within the `documentation` directory).
