## Getting involved in ACCESS-AM3

There are several ways we welcome feedback and contributions on ACCESS-AM3 development. **Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged. Development is led by ACCESS-NRI, the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Weather in the 21st Century (W21C).** We follow an open development workflow where possible building on the work of international modelling groups.

### Interact with developers in person

If you would like to interact in person with the development team, there are regular Land Working Group meetings on the first and third Wednesday of every month (see [this thread](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/land-working-group-announce/355) on the Hive Forum) and Atmosphere Working Group meetings are organised on an ad-hoc basis (see [this thread](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/announce-atmosphere-working-group/568) on the Hive Forum). Everyone is welcome to suggest agenda items and participate (see the threads for the respective agendas). If you'd like to come, get in touch on ACCESS-Hive forum either under the [ACCESS-AM3](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/atmosphere/am3/243) category.

We also manage most of our development on GitHub. We track AM3 work on a [GitHub project board here](https://github.com/orgs/ACCESS-NRI/projects/35). If you'd like to have your issue considered for AM3 development, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs/issues/new) on the ACCESS-AM3 configurations repository.

!!! warning
    The ACCESS-AM3 configurations repository is private due to UK Met Office licensing restrictions. If you would like to get involved, please get in contact with us on the [Hive forum]() to request access. **[TODO] This is something we don't want public yet? Feels very contradictory to say "All contributions, please come get involved" and then say "but wait our repository is private"**

### Help us evaluate and improve applications of AM

**[TODO] Update this section after it is clarified in the next Atmosphere WG meeting.**

<!--
We have a community based group the "AM3 Dev-Eval Working group" that are helping with AM3 evaluation and development. Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged. To join the meetings follow the announcements [here](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/esm-working-group-announce/567/67).

There's agenda (before the meeting) and minutes (after) the meetings [here](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/am3-dev-eval-working-group-meeting-minutes-2025/5393), anyone can share a figure or contribute to the agenda. 

All community members (and ACCESS-NRI staff) can get [write access to the AM3 evaluation repository](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-am3-paper-1/). To get write access, you need to create an issue and request access, [please use this issue template](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-am3-paper-1/issues/new?template=add-user-request-to--access-am3-1-repository-.md). Evaluation figures are being coordinated [here](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-am3-paper-1/issues/1).

### Report a bug or make a suggestion

Technical issues related to AM3 are best posted to [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/dev-coupling/issues](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/dev_coupling/issues/new). If you would like to discuss the issue first, feel free to post it on the [ACCESS-HIVE forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/esm/coupled-model/71).

## ACCESS-AM3-configs-doc documentation contributions welcome 🙏
This documentation is a work in progress, and we welcome any contributions, including corrections and suggestions.

All contributions are welcome but we would particularly appreciate text suggestions (below). Contributions can be made in a few ways:

### Quick contributions 
!!! tip
    This method has the advantage that it's *very quick* (<1 minute!). The caveat is that, unless you have write access to the `access-am3-configs-doc` repository, you will not be able to preview the changes rendered into a website or create whole new pages. <br>

The simplest and fastest way to make a change to an _existing_ page is to click the edit "pencil" on the top-right corner. This will go to the relevant GitHub markdown file and clicking the top-right pencil again on GitHub will allow you to edit the file. Once complete, click `Commit changes...`. There are then _two_ possibilities, depending on whether you have  write access to [`access-am3-configs-doc`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc): 

1.  **No write access**: this will prompt you to make a fork and then a pull request (less than 1 minute!). 
1.  **You have write access**: please commit changes on a new branch and then use a pull request (this relates to the next option). 

### Larger contributions (online PR-previews)
!!! tip
    This method allows you create whole new pages, and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It does not require you to install any software, but is **only available for people with write access to [`access-am3-configs-doc`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc)**.<br>

Create a new branch, e.g. `jblogs/doc-update`, make doc changes (the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation)), then open a related PR and a GitHub preview will be made automatically. 

### Larger contributions (`mkdocs` offline)
!!! tip
    This method allows you create whole new pages and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It works whether or not you have write access to [`access-am3-configs-doc`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc), but requires you to install `mkdocs` and takes the longest to set up.<br>

Following [these instructions](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/#lets-get-started) but noting the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc/tree/main/documentation). You'll need to [fork](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/#clone-the-forked-access-hive-docs-github-repository-locally) and clone [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-am3-configs-doc) if you want to write your own content (`mkdocs serve` should be invoked from within the `documentation` directory).
